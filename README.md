Code samples that go along with the book _The Go Programming Language_ by Alan A. A. Donovan & Brian W. Kernighan.  

There may be some articles coming soon. Samples are written with .NET Core 3.1 in C# and F#. These are all console applications (for now), so they should run cross-platform.

* **1 - Tutorial**  
* **2 - Program Structure**  
* **3 - Basic Data Types**
